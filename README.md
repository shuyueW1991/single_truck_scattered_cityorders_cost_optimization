# single_truck_scattered_cityorders_cost_optimization
I have a truck, and I have several assigned orders that involves many cities. What is the route for the truck that leads to a minimized cost about taking shipment at the starting point of an order, releasing shipment at the ending point of an order, and distancial coverage consumption.
